High level overview:

1. Track: Concierge Agents

2. Problem and solution pitch: Hiring a personal trainer, let alone a suite of experts dedicated to improving one's wellness, is expensive both monetarily and in terms of time spent interacting with said experts. We built an agentic wellness suite of agents (e.g. fitness trainer agent, nutritionist agent, etc.) to help users achieve better wellness outcomes.
