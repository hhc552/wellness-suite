      "### Part 1: Fitness Plan (Provided by FitnessTrainerAgent)\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan is structured in quarterly phases, allowing for gradual progression and adaptation. Each phase builds upon the last, increasing intensity and complexity. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional or a certified personal trainer before starting any new fitness program.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Principles for Your Year-Long Transformation:**\n",
      "1.  **Caloric Deficit for Weight Loss**: Aim for a moderate deficit of 250-500 calories per day for sustainable fat loss.\n",
      "2.  **Prioritize Protein for Muscle Building**: Target 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of your body weight daily.\n",
      "3.  **Balanced Macronutrients**: Include quality carbohydrates for energy and healthy fats for hormone production and overall health. Focus on whole foods.\n",
      "4.  **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase the stress placed on your muscles (heavier weights, more repetitions/sets, increased frequency).\n",
      "5.  **Consistency**: Regularity in both diet and exercise is paramount.\n",
      "6.  **Rest and Recovery**: Adequate sleep and rest days are vital for muscle growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Months 1-3 (Foundation & Adaptation)**\n",
      "*   **Goal**: Learn proper form, build a baseline of strength and endurance, and establish consistent habits.\n",
      "*   **Workout Frequency**: 3-4 days of strength training, 2-3 days of cardio.\n",
      "*   **Strength Training (3 days/week - Full Body)**: Focus on compound bodyweight exercises and light free weights (2-3 sets of 10-15 reps).\n",
      "    *   **Lower Body**: Bodyweight Squats, Glute Bridges, Lunges, Calf Raises.\n",

      "*   **Cardio (2-3 days/week - Moderate Intensity)**: 30 minutes per session (Brisk walking, light jogging, cycling, elliptical).\n",
      "*   **Rest**: 1-2 full rest days and 1 active recovery day.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 2: Months 4-6 (Building & Intensity)**\n",
      "*   **Goal**: Increase strength, muscle mass, and cardiovascular fitness. Introduce progressive overload.\n",
      "*   **Workout Frequency**: 4 days of strength training, 2-3 days of cardio.\n",
      "*   **Strength Training (4 days/week - Split Routine e.g., Upper/Lower)**: Increase weight or repetitions (aim for 8-12 reps for hypertrophy), 3-4 sets. Start incorporating progressive overload.\n",
      "    *   **Upper Body Day**: Bench Press, Overhead Press, Bent-Over Rows, Lat Pulldowns, Bicep Curls, Tricep Extensions.\n",
      "    *   **Lower Body & Core Day**: Barbell Squats, Romanian Deadlifts, Leg Press, Leg Curls, Leg Extensions, Plank variations, Russian Twists.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Phase 3: Months 7-9 (Advanced Progression)**\n",
      "*   **Goal**: Further intensify training, break plateaus, and enhance body composition.\n",
      "*   **Workout Frequency**: 4-5 days of strength training, 2-3 days of cardio.\n",
      "*   **Strength Training (4-5 days/week - Advanced Split, e.g., Push/Pull/Legs)**: Continue progressive overload with increased weights, reps, or sets. Experiment with supersets, drop sets, or shorter rest periods.\n",
      "*   **Cardio (2-3 days/week - Continued HIIT & Moderate)**: Maintain HIIT sessions, possibly increasing duration or intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 4: Months 10-12 (Refinement & Consistency)**\n",
      "*   **Goal**: Consolidate gains, maintain progress, and make adjustments based on results.\n",
      "*   **Workout Frequency**: 4-5 days of strength training, 2-3 days of cardio.\n",
      "*   **Strength Training**: Focus on consistency and continuing progressive overload. Consider periodization.\n",
      "*   **Cardio**: Maintain a balance of moderate and high-intensity cardio.\n",
      "*   **Active Recovery & Flexibility**: Incorporate regular stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n",
